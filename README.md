## ✅ Rules and Guidelines

### 🔐 Branching
- `main` is always **production-ready**.
- Use feature branches:  
  `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/fix-splash-delay`, etc.

### 📦 Commits
- Use clear commit messages like:
  ```
  feat: add login screen
  fix: resolve crash on Android
  chore: update dependencies
  ```

### 📥 Pull Requests
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Always open a **Pull Request**.
- Request at least 1 review before merging.

### 🧪 Testing
- Test your feature locally before pushing.
- If a test framework is added, pass all tests before PR.

### 🧹 Code Style
- Use Prettier and ESLint (or Flutter format rules).
- Keep code clean and modular.
